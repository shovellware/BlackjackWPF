## Blackjack in WPF
In progress. This will be a 1 player, user vs dealer game of blackjack. I have designed the game logic in it's own class library, seperate from the UI, so that I can resue the same code for different applications without redoing everything. This has helped me so far in working on tasks individually, getting one piece to work before moving on to the next. 

#### Desired Features to Add
- Betting
- Clear set of rules for dealer to follow
- Double Down
- Split
- Images for each card
- Table Background
- Ace can be 1 or 11 (currently 11)
- Multiple human players
